# Portfolio Website to display code and other projects. 

Created used HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. Everything was coded and designed by myself and I am self taught in these Languages/Frameworks. 
With this website, I plan to learn additional Languages/Frameworks such as MySQL to implement more real world projects. 

Commits are everything from major UI overhauls, to minor bug fixes. With the most troublesome so far being improperly formatted on Mobile (now fixed).

Written on Visual Studio Code, all commits are written on VS code by myself and then tested before the Site Deployment on GitHub Pages. I will never deploy the website unless it is working as I desire it to.
